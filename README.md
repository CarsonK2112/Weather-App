# Weather-App

The purpose of this app is to render a weather forecast to the screen while listing the cities previously searched on the left hand side.

AJAX calls were created to gather the data from the API. The app then utilizes local storage to capture the saved city searches as well as the requisite weather data to then be retrieved when it is rendered to the web-page.

Bootstrap was utilized in the formatting of the page, which is unfortunately rushed due to my backlog of HW assignments. May return at a later date to polish the app.
